Description: A toolbox to derive flexible cutoffs for fit indices in
    'Covariance-based Structural Equation Modeling' based on the paper by
    'Niemand & Mai (2018)' <doi:10.1007/s11747-018-0602-9>. Flexible
    cutoffs are an alternative to fixed cutoffs - rules-of-thumb -
    regarding an appropriate cutoff for fit indices such as 'CFI' or
    'SRMR'. It has been demonstrated that these flexible cutoffs perform
    better than fixed cutoffs in grey areas where misspecification is not
    easy to detect. The package provides an alternative to the tool at
    <https://flexiblecutoffs.org> as it allows to tailor flexible cutoffs
    to a given dataset and model, which is so far not available in the
    tool. The package simulates fit indices based on a given dataset and
    model and then estimates the flexible cutoffs. Some useful functions,
    e.g., to determine the 'GoF-' or 'BoF-nature' of a fit index, are
    provided. So far, additional options for a relative use (is a model
    better than another?) are provided in an exploratory manner.
